# sgustafson.github.io
This is a repository showing many of the projects I worked on during my coding certification program.  Some projects are rudimentory, progressing through to more complicated ones. 

#Projects
Each project has its own README file.

#License
Most projects in this repository are licensed by MIT.  There are, however, several projects I created on my own.
